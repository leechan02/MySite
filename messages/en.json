        "In 2022, I started my journey into development without knowing how to code or use a terminal. As I grew more curious about the world, I recognized many inefficiencies around me and realized the importance of problem-solving.",
        "This led me to 42 Seoul, where I immersed myself in computer science fundamentals such as operating systems, data structures, and networks. Currently, I am focusing on frontend development to address real-world challenges."

        "I appreciate beauty, which is why I prioritize writing clean, understandable, and simple code. While optimization is important, I don&apos;t believe complex code is always better-performing.",
        "As a developer, I value communication skills, especially since development is rarely a solo effort. Starting from scratch has taught me how to explain concepts clearly and in a way that others can easily understand."

      "rightFirstContent": [
        "I have a lot of curiosity and a strong desire to learn. The more I study, the more I realize how much I don’t know. Since I&apos;ve had less time to study than others, I’ve worked even harder to catch up.",
        "Through this, I&apos;ve learned that while things can be difficult, nothing is impossible. I&apos;ve solved problems, completed over 300 code reviews, and written over 10,000 lines of code in a single project. This has made me unafraid of learning new technologies. Despite having no prior experience with frameworks like React or Next.js, I built a website using Next.js in just two weeks."

      "rightSecondTitle": "In my spare time,",
      "rightSecondContent": [
        "I enjoy learning, taking on challenges, and documenting my journey.",
        "Out of curiosity, I read books to learn. I love challenges, so I dive in and try things—recently, I climbed the Himalayas. I believe that knowledge becomes truly mine when I write and speak about it, which is why I run a YouTube channel like a personal journal. While I’m not a huge fan of exercise, I do it because I need to stay healthy to keep doing what I love."
