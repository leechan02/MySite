        "Key features include the use of I/O multiplexing with `poll()` (or equivalent), ensuring the server never blocks or hangs indefinitely, and the ability to serve static websites while supporting multiple HTTP methods.By implementing these advanced concepts, Webserv not only serves as a practical learning tool for understanding web server architecture but also demonstrates the power and flexibility of C++ in creating high-performance network applications. The successful completion of this project showcases a deep understanding of network protocols, system-level programming, and efficient resource management in a challenging, real-world scenario."
